```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

library(mdsr)
library(tidyverse)
library(mosaic)
library(RMySQL)

con <- dbConnect(
  MySQL(), host = "scidb.smith.edu",
  user = "waiuser", password = "smith_waiDB", 
  dbname = "wai"
)
Measurements <- tbl(con, "Measurements")
```

Problem 1 (Easy): How many rows are available in the Measurements table of the Smith College Wideband Auditory Immittance database?

There are 1,349,667 rows available. 

```{r } 
Measurements %>%
  collect() #This collect function gets all the data from the server and stores it on my machine. I haven't saved it as anything. 

```
