Mammals are back 

```{r}
library(openintro)
library(tidyverse)
library(RColorBrewer)
library(ggthemes)
```

```{r}
president
```


Let's play with themes. Add theme_bw(), theme_economist(), theme_dark(), theme_classic()

```{r}
president |>
  ggplot(aes(x=start, y =end, color = party) )+
  geom_point()+
  theme_bw()

```

What does factor do? 

Let's play with some colors. [Here are the color brewer choices](https://r-graph-gallery.com/38-rcolorbrewers-palettes.html)

Add scale_fill_brewer

```{r}
president |>
  ggplot(aes( x = party,fill=party) )+
  geom_bar()+
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Greens") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1))
           
```

Let's make a histogram of sleep hours

```{r}
mammals |>
  ggplot(aes(x =brain_wt, fill = factor(danger) ))+
  geom_histogram()   +
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "blue",high = "red")

```
