I'm stuck on this problem. I need to think about it more. 

```{r }
head(flights)
head(planes)

joined_flights_planes <-left_join(flights,planes,by="tailnum")
```

```{r part_a}


#I'm trying to filter out the nas from the year variable
#I'm using the apply function to apply is.na() to the table
apply(X = is.na(planes), MARGIN = 2, FUN = sum)

#Students might use these pipes instead. 
planes %>%
  count(is.na(year))

planes %>%
  filter(is.na(year))

```

```{r part_b}
# I think this is a simpler solution. 

planes %>%
  count(manufacturer) %>%
  slice_max(order_by = n,n=5)

#The following table shows the most common manufacturer by counts. The case_when() checks to see if the count is larger or smaller than 121 and renames the manufacturer variable appropriately. 

manufactured_counts<- planes %>%
  count(manufacturer) %>%
  arrange(desc(n)) %>%
  mutate(
    manufacturer = 
      case_when(
        n >= 121 ~ as.character(manufacturer),
        n < 121 ~ "other" 
    )
  )%>%
  group_by(manufacturer) %>%
  summarise(manufacturer=manufacturer,n=sum(n)) %>%
  distinct()


manufactured_counts


```

```{r part_c}

top_five_manufactures <-planes %>%
  count(manufacturer) %>%
  slice_max(order_by = n,n=5) %>%
  select(-n)

top_five_manufactures <- as.vector(top_five_manufactures)

joined_flights_planes |>
  filter(manufacturer %in% unlist(top_five_manufactures)) |>
  ggplot(aes(x= month,y=manufacturer))+
  geom_count()
  

#I need to join manufactured_counts with joined_flights_planes 



# #I had to group by month, you can also group by month,day 
# joined_fl_pl_manufactured_counts<- inner_join(joined_flights_planes,manufactured_counts,by="manufacturer") %>%
#   group_by(month) %>%
#   count(manufacturer)
# 
# #This shows the number of flights from each type of carrier every month. I think this answers the question. 
# 
# joined_fl_pl_manufactured_counts %>%
#    
#    ggplot(aes(month,n,color=manufacturer))+
#    
#    geom_point()
#    
```
